Project Title: CodeGuard ‚Äì AI-Powered Code Security Auditor..

üöÄ Project Overview CodeGuard is an AI assistant that reviews source code to detect security vulnerabilities, insecure coding practices, and potential exploits. Using Large Language Models (LLMs) with prompt engineering, it analyzes code snippets and returns structured feedback highlighting risks and suggesting secure fixes.

The project leverages zero-shot, one-shot, multi-shot, dynamic, and chain-of-thought prompting to improve the precision and coverage of security analysis. Additionally, embeddings and vector databases enable context-aware vulnerability detection by matching similar known exploits.

üîß Features

Thanks for the detailed project outline. You're building **CodeGuard**, an AI-powered code security auditor that applies advanced prompting strategies (Zero/One/Multi-shot, Dynamic, Chain-of-Thought), LLMs, and vector search for vulnerability detection.

To help you **mirror the structure** you've described for **AlgoSage** but tailored for **CodeGuard**, here‚Äôs a refined and **RTFC-aligned prompt schema** for your system:

---

## üõ°Ô∏è CodeGuard ‚Äì AI Code Security Auditor Prompt Framework (RTFC-Aligned)

---

### üîπ System Prompt (Role)

```text
You are an AI Code Security Auditor.

Your role is to analyze the given code snippet for security vulnerabilities. You must identify insecure coding practices, potential exploits, and recommend secure alternatives. Return structured output in **valid JSON** format with the following fields:

- issues: List of detected security flaws.
- suggestions: Recommended secure coding practices or fixes.
- overall_security_rating: One of ["High Risk", "Medium Risk", "Low Risk"].
```

---

### üîπ User Prompt (Task + Context)

```text
Review the following {{language}} code for security vulnerabilities and provide feedback as per the defined JSON schema:

{{code_snippet}}
```

---

### üìå RTFC Framework Usage

* **R (Role):** Clearly defined as an **AI Code Security Auditor**.
* **T (Task):** Analyze code to detect security flaws and recommend secure practices.
* **F (Format):** Must return a valid **JSON object** with fields: `issues`, `suggestions`, `overall_security_rating`.
* **C (Context):** Includes code snippet and programming language information (e.g., Python, JavaScript, C++, etc.).

---

### ‚úÖ Example Prompt and Output (RTFC Compliant)

**üßæ User Input:**

```text
Review the following Python code for security vulnerabilities:

def login(user_input):
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + user_input + "'"
    execute(query)
```

**ü§ñ Expected Output (JSON):**

```json
{
  "issues": [
    "SQL Injection vulnerability due to unsafe string concatenation."
  ],
  "suggestions": [
    "Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to safely handle user input."
  ],
  "overall_security_rating": "High Risk"
}
üîê Zero-Shot Prompting in CodeGuard (Python Only)

In CodeGuard, we use Zero-Shot Prompting to detect security vulnerabilities in Python code without providing any prior examples.
The AI understands the task from the prompt instructions alone ‚Äî no demonstrations needed.
This enables scalable, adaptive, and language-focused auditing across a wide range of Python codebases.

üîπ Zero-Shot Prompt Template (Python)

System Prompt:
You are an AI Code Security Auditor. Analyze the given Python code snippet, identify security vulnerabilities, recommend secure coding fixes, and provide an overall security rating.
Always return results in JSON format with the following fields:

issues: List of detected security flaws

suggestions: Recommended security improvements

overall_security_rating: A summary rating (e.g., "High Risk", "Medium Risk", "Low Risk")

User Prompt:
Review the following Python code and provide a structured security audit:

{{code_snippet}}

‚úÖ Zero-Shot Prompting Examples (Python)
üîé Example 1
def process(data):
    exec(data)


AI Output:

{
  "issues": ["Use of 'exec' with untrusted input can lead to code execution vulnerabilities."],
  "suggestions": ["Avoid using 'exec' on user input. Validate and sanitize data, or refactor logic to avoid dynamic execution."],
  "overall_security_rating": "High Risk"
}
---

üîê One-Shot Prompting in CodeGuard (Python Only)

In CodeGuard, we apply One-Shot Prompting, where the AI is provided with a single example to demonstrate the expected input-output behavior.
This helps guide the model with a concrete example while keeping the prompt concise and flexible.
It enhances the model's performance in detecting Python-specific security vulnerabilities.

üîπ One-Shot Prompt Template (Python)

System Prompt:
You are an AI Code Security Auditor. Analyze Python code snippets, detect security vulnerabilities, and suggest secure coding practices.
Return results in JSON format with the following fields:

issues: List of detected security flaws

suggestions: Recommended security improvements

overall_security_rating: A summary rating (e.g., "High Risk", "Medium Risk", "Low Risk")

User Prompt (with one example):

üß™ Example Input (Python):

password = input("Enter password: ")
if password == "1234":
    print("Access granted")


Example Expected Output:

{
  "issues": ["Hardcoded password detected, which is insecure."],
  "suggestions": ["Use secure password storage and verification methods like hashing with bcrypt."],
  "overall_security_rating": "High Risk"
}

üîç Now analyze this Python code:
def process(data):
    exec(data)


Expected Output (AI Response):

{
  "issues": ["Use of 'exec' with untrusted input can lead to arbitrary code execution."],
  "suggestions": ["Avoid using 'exec' on untrusted input. Refactor the code to use safer alternatives."],
  "overall_security_rating": "High Risk"
}


üìå Why One-Shot Prompting (Python)?

üìò Guidance with flexibility: One clear example helps the AI align with expected output format and tone

üîê Security-focused learning: The example demonstrates a common vulnerability, encouraging consistent detection

üêç Python-specific accuracy: Helps the model handle language nuances like exec, eval, and string injection

‚ö° Low overhead: More effective than zero-shot for nuanced issues, yet still lightweight compared to multi-shot prompts


üîπ Multi-Shot Prompt

System Prompt:
You are an AI code reviewer. Analyze the given code, detect security vulnerabilities, and suggest fixes.
Always return results in JSON format with three fields: issues, suggestions, and overall_feedback..

User Prompt (with multiple examples):

Example 1 (Python):

def login(user_input):
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + user_input + "'"
    execute(query)


Expected Output:

{
  "issues": ["SQL Injection vulnerability due to unsafe string concatenation."],
  "suggestions": ["Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection."],
  "overall_feedback": "Critical security flaw detected due to lack of input sanitization."
}


Example 2 (JavaScript):

eval(userInput);


Expected Output:

{
  "issues": ["Use of eval on user input leads to remote code execution risk."],
  "suggestions": ["Avoid using eval. Use safer alternatives like JSON.parse or direct function calls when possible."],
  "overall_feedback": "High-risk pattern found; using eval on untrusted input is dangerous."
}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
üîπ Dynamic Prompting

üß† What is Dynamic Prompting?
Dynamic prompting adjusts the prompt in real time using placeholders that are filled with user-specific or runtime data‚Äîlike the programming language and code snippet. This allows the LLM to better understand the context and produce more relevant, high-quality results.

‚úÖ Dynamic Prompt Template

üîπ System Prompt Template:

You are a code security auditor. Analyze the following {{language}} code snippet, detect security vulnerabilities, and suggest fixes. 
Return the output as a JSON object with the following structure:

{
  "issues": [List of security issues found],
  "suggestions": [Recommended secure coding practices or fixes],
  "overall_security_rating": "High Risk | Medium Risk | Low Risk"
}

üî∏ Example Invocation with Filled Template

User Prompt:

Review this JavaScript code:

document.write(userInput);


Final Prompt Sent to Model:

You are a code security auditor. Analyze the following JavaScript code snippet, detect security vulnerabilities, and suggest fixes. 
Return the output as a JSON object with the following structure:

{
  "issues": [List of security issues found],
  "suggestions": [Recommended secure coding practices or fixes],
  "overall_security_rating": "High Risk | Medium Risk | Low Risk"
}

Review this JavaScript code:

document.write(userInput);


Expected Output:

{
  "issues": ["Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability."],
  "suggestions": ["Use proper input sanitization or DOMPurify to sanitize input before inserting into the DOM."],
  "overall_security_rating": "Medium Risk"
}

.............
### üß† Chain-of-Thought Prompting Version (Internal Thinking)

**System Prompt:**

```text
You are a code security auditor. Think step-by-step internally about possible security issues in the code, but output **only** the final result in valid JSON. Do not show your reasoning.
```

**User Prompt:**

```text
Review the following Python code:

def authenticate(user_input):
    if user_input == "admin":
        grant_access()
```

**Expected Output:**

```json
{
  "issues": [
    "Hardcoded admin username check without proper authentication mechanism."
  ],
  "suggestions": [
    "Use a secure authentication system with hashed credentials and role-based access control."
  ],
  "overall_security_rating": "High Risk"
}
```
Evaluation Dataset & Testing Framework (Python Only)
